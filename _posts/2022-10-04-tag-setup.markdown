# 3. Triggers
A Trigger is an event suceptible of delivering a campaign to an end user. A trigger event will send the latest user data to our server and return the campaigns eligible for display.

The default trigger is the pageview event sent after a page is fully loaded. To add custom triggers call the previous track function with parameter trigger set to "true".

These trigger will result in an API call to https://cibler.io/api/campaigns/eligibility/?customerId={{customerId}}. The result of this api call contains the eligibility of the user to the campaign and information about the incentive.

The tag will automatically make another call to retrieve the content of every eligible campaign and display the content except if the rendering tag is disabled, no content is set or if an external content integration has been setup.

# 4. Advanced features

These settings can be setup in pure javascript or using a google tag manager as intermediary layer.
First initialize the advanced context object
